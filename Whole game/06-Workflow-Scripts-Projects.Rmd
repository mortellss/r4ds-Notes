# Scripts

R script -> Ctrl + Shift + N

It is great to write your code and try it.

Execute the entirety of the code -> Ctrl + Shift + Enter

Execute part of the code -> Ctrl + Enter

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

not_cancelled <- flights |> 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled |> 
  group_by(year, month, day) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```


## Saving and naming

- File names should be machine readable: avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters.
- File names should be human readable: use file names to describe whatâ€™s in the file.
- File names should play well with default ordering: start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.

# Projects

To handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:

1. What is the source of truth? What will you save as your lasting record of what happened?
  - Source of truth should be R scripts

2. Where does your analysis live?


Other keyboard shortcuts
 - Ctrl + Shift + 0 -> Restart R
 - Ctrl + Shift + S -> Re-run the current script


The best way to store all the projects is in the RStudio Projects

Never use absolute paths in the scripts
